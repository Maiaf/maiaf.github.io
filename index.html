<h1 style** **="text-align=center;">About Me</h1>

<p><br> Hi my name is Maia, and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin! As of right now, I am a finance major but plan on getting a minor in MIS. I am from Houston TX (houston houston), and have a little sister named Sofi. My favorite things to do are probably binge watch TV shows and eat at new places. I also love to play volleyball and tennis and travel to new places when I get the chance! </br></p>
