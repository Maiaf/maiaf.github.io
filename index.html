<p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> 
  Hi my name is Maia, and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin! As of right now, I am a finance major but plan on getting a minor in MIS.
  I am from Houston TX (houston houston), and have a little sister named Sofi. My favorite things to do are probably binge watch TV shows and eat at new places. 
  I also love to play volleyball and tennis and travel to new places when I get the chance!</p>
