    Your text will show here. And you can scroll down to go through all of it. You just have to add a sufficient amount of text to make the scrollbars show. Obviously, 
    this is not enough,o let’s assume we have a little more to say. Eventually, the scrollbars will come in handy. That’s it! :)</div>

<h1 style** **="text-align=center;">About Me</h1>

<p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> 
  Hi my name is Maia, and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin! As of right now, I am a finance major but plan on getting a minor in MIS.
  I am from Houston TX (houston houston), and have a little sister named Sofi. My favorite things to do are probably binge watch TV shows and eat at new places. 
  I also love to play volleyball and tennis and travel to new places when I get the chance!</p>
